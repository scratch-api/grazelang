## Credits

@aspizu created a wonderful project called [`goboscript`](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript). When I saw it, I was impressed. While it is a truly marvelous technical achievement, I somehow disliked the syntax of goboscript. Because of that, I started working on an alternative. Another reason for creating graze was to address the fact that goboscript could not fully map to all Vanilla Scratch projects. 

I used rust to create graze and was also inspired by rust for graze's syntax.
