@aspizu created a wonderful project called [`goboscript`](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript). When I saw it, I was impressed. While it is an impressive technical achievement, I disliked the syntax of the language, which is why I wanted to create an alternative. Another reason for creating this alternative was to address the fact that goboscript could not fully map to all Vanilla Scratch projects.
